# Puppet Server

Puppet Server is the next-generation application for managing Puppet agents.
It is the platform that will carry Puppet's server-side components to a more
distributed, service-oriented architecture.  It has been built on top of the
same technologies that have made PuppetDB successful, and will allow us to make
great leaps forward in performance, scalability, advanced metrics collection,
and fine-grained control over the Ruby runtime.
