# Puppet Server

NOTE: This is a *preview* release; while it should function as a drop-in replacement
for an existing Puppet Master in most cases, it is not recommended for use in
production without thorough testing in a staging environment.

Puppet Server is the next-generation application for managing Puppet agents.
It is the platform that will carry Puppet's server-side components to a more
distributed, service-oriented architecture.  It has been built on top of the
same technologies that have made PuppetDB successful, and will allow us to make
great leaps forward in performance, scalability, advanced metrics collection,
and fine-grained control over the Ruby runtime.

# Special thanks to

## Cursive Clojure

[Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/) is a Clojure IDE based on
[IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html).  Several of
us at Puppet Labs use it regularly and couldn't live without it.  It's got
some really great editing, refactoring, and debugging features, and the author,
Colin Fleming, has been amazingly helpful and responsive when we have feedback.
If you're a Clojure developer you should definitely check it out!

## JRuby

[JRuby](http://jruby.org/) is an implementation of the Ruby programming language
that runs on the JVM.  It's a fantastic project, and it is the bridge that allows
us to run all of the existing Puppet Ruby code while taking advantage of all of
the advanced features and libraries that are available on the JVM.  We're very
grateful to the developers for building such a great product and for helping us
work through a few bugs that we've discovered along the way.
